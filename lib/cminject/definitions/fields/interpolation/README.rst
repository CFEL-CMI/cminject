Purpose
=======

Fast-Cubic-Spline-Python provides an implementation of fast spline
interpolation algorithm of `Habermann and Kindermann (2007)`_ in Python.  While
higher dimensional interpolation is also possible with this code, currently
only 1D and 2D examples are provided.

Calculation of spline coefficients are in NumPy, and actual interpolation
routine is coded in Cython. This is advantageous since if your main routine is
coded in Cython, once you have coefficients, you can call interpolation
functions without any Python overhead.

*****
Usage
*****

Run the main module for an example:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ python fast_cubic_spline.py
