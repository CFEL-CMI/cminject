Welcome to CMInject's documentation!
====================================

CMInject is a Python3 framework that can be used to define and run nanoparticle trajectory simulations.
It can run 1D, 2D and 3D simulations, given that all parts in a simulation setup allow the given dimensionality.

It is meant to be used by different groups of people and match different needs, and so it is meant to be all of the following:

- a library that provides a generic way to define and run whole simulation setups
- a collection of such setups
- a collection of executables and library code for processing, analyzing and visualizing simulation results
