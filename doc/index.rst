Welcome to CMInject's documentation!
====================================

CMInject is a Python3 framework that can be used to define and run nanoparticle
trajectory simulations. It can run 1D, 2D and 3D (or other) simulations, given
that all parts in a simulation setup allow the given dimensionality.

It is meant to be used by different groups of people and match different needs,
and so it is meant to be all of the following:

- a library that provides a generic way to define and run simulations of
  experimental setups
- a collection of such setups
- a collection of executables and library code for processing, analyzing and
  visualizing simulation results

If you intend on (only) using CMInject for defining and running your own virtual
experiments, please refer to the :ref:`user-guide`. If you intend on adding
experiments that other people can use as well, or developing CMInject further,
please refer to the :ref:`developer-guide`.
