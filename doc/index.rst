Welcome to CMInject's documentation!
====================================

CMInject is a Python3 framework that can be used to define and run particle trajectory simulations
for sample injection. It can run 1D, 2D and 3D simulations, given that all parts in a simulation setup allow
the given dimensionality.

It is meant to be used by different groups of people and match different needs, and so it is meant to be both:

- a library that provides a generic way to define and run whole simulation setups, and
- a collection of such setups (coming soon).
