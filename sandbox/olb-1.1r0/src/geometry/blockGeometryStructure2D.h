/// Representation of a block geometry structure
/** This pure virtual class provides an interface for the classes
 * block geometry and block geometry view. It presents a volume
 * of voxels. Different types are given my material numbers
 * which is imporant e.g. to work with different boundaries
 * (like for inflow/output regions). Several methods are
 * provided to rename material numbers of a type at several
 * nodes at once. Further clearing methods are provided to
 * rename material in order to obtain a robust mesh as well
 * as a method which checks the mesh for possible errors. The
 * member variable statistics provides integral information
 * about the mesh and their materials.
 *
 * This class is intended to be derived from.
