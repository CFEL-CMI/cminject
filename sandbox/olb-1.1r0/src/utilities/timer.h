/** \file
 This class allows calculation and display of various time data including remaining runtime data in cpu and in user time. Output is possible during computation and as a summary after computation. Time can be measured independently from in-computation-calls which allows time statistics without touching the overall computation time of the LBM-algorithm. Moreover it is possible to determine a performance number, the Mega Lattice Updates per second (MLUPs).
The template type T denotes the internal representation of time differences (in ms, s and for cpu-time). Reasonable values are eg. double and long.
 Some thoughts about data range: Actually, only positive numbers should occur (=> unsigned). The chosen data format should be capable of representing at least 7 days ( = 604.800.000 ms) of computation time. The biggest signed long32 number ist 2.147.483.647 (~3 1/2 weeks), great! For everything above, use double with it's floating point arithmetic.

/** How to use in Code:
  <pre>
  Timer timer;
  timer.inizialize();

  timer.start();

  loop(i=1..iMax)
  {
    do_some_calculation();
    timer.print(i);
  } end_loop;

  timer.stop();

  timer.printSummary();
  </pre>
*/

/* BUGS:
- first time step yields some crazy numbers in remaining time if Template parameter is double
- cavity2d with 20 seconds yields average MLUPs values much smaller than the ones 'live in computation' (with T=int, due to integer overflow)
