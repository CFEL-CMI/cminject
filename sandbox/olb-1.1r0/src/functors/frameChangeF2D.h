/** \file
  This file contains two different classes of functors, in the FIRST part
  - for simulations in a rotating frame
  - different functors for
      velocity (3d, RotatingLinear3D),
      pressure (1d, RotatingQuadratic1D) and
      force    (3d, RotatingForceField3D)
  The functors return the displacement of a point x in a fixed amount of time.

  The ones in the SECOND part are useful to set Poiseuille velocity profiles on
  - pipes with round cross-section and
  - pipes with square-shaped cross-section.

/** To enable simulations in a rotating frame, the axis is set in the
  * constructor with axisPoint and axisDirection. The axisPoint can be the
  * coordinate of any point on the axis. The axisDirection has to be a normed to
  * 1. The pulse w is in rad/s. It determines the pulse speed by its norm while
  * the trigonometric or clockwise direction is determined by its sign: When the
  * axisDirection is pointing "towards you", a positive pulse makes it turn in
  * the trigonometric way. It has to be noticed that putting both axisDirection
  * into -axisDirection and w into -w yields an exactly identical situation.
