CMI richmol
===========

This program can calculate, view, and analyze the energy levels of adiabatic
Stark energy curves of linear, symmetric top and asymmetric top molecules.

The program package is developed and maintained by the Controlled Molecule
Imaging group (CMI) at the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science (CFEL),
Hamburg, Germany.

CMI richmol uses Sphinx documentation; please see the online documentation at
<to be added> or create your local documentation in ./doc/.build/ by running
    python setup.py build_sphinx
