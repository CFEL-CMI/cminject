CMI injector
============

This program is a simulation framework that integrates particles' trajectories guided by several forcefields (i.e. drag and optical forces)

The program package is developed and maintained by the Controlled Molecule
Imaging group (CMI) at the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science (CFEL),
Hamburg, Germany.

CMI injector uses Sphinx documentation; please see the online documentation at
<to be added> or create your local documentation in ./doc/.build/ by running
    python setup.py build_sphinx
