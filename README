CMIvibrot
=========

The CMIvibrot project provides a user-friendly program suite for the simulation
of the rotational and vibrational motion in external electric fields.

This first version implements the quantum-mechanical simulation of arbitrary
rigid-rotor molecules in arbitrary time-dependent electric fields.
